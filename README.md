# nebula-static

- Setup Your Development Environment:
  - Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine.
  - Set up a new project directory for your static site generator.

- Choose Dependencies:
  - Decide on npm packages that you'll need. For example:
  - handlebars for template rendering.
  - fs-extra for file system operations.
  
- Create a Directory Structure:
  - Establish a directory structure to organize your project (source files, templates, output folder, etc.).

- Write the Core Logic:
  - Use fs-extra to read the source files.
  - Use handlebars to compile templates and generate HTML files.
  - Implement logic to traverse through your source files, apply templates, and generate the HTML output.

- Implement Handlebars Templates:
  - Create .hbs files for different parts of your site (header, footer, content templates, etc.).
  - Use Handlebars syntax to define placeholders and logic within these templates.

- Generate the Site:
  - Write the code that combines content with templates.
  - Use Handlebars to fill in the placeholders with the content dynamically.
  - Save the generated HTML files to the output directory.

- Testing and Optimization:
  - Implement error handling and testing to ensure the generator works as expected.
  - Consider optimizations like minification of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
